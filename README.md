## About 
[*Band Radar*](https://landonbaker.me/projects/bandradar) is a 2-day MVP project that allows users to browse upcoming local concerts through TicketMaster and play artists' top tracks with Spotify player integration.

## Initial Implementation
This application was an exercise in rapid development to see what could be accomplished in a very limited timeframe of 2 days. The following user stories were successfully implemented in the initial timeframe:
 * As a user, I want to see 40 upcoming concerts in the Austin, TX metro area
 * As a user, I want to see concert info (date, venue, ticket price, etc.) for each show
 * As a user, I want to have clickable links to buy tickets for each show
 * As a user, I want to be able to click on a concert and see all of the artists that will be performing - not just the headlining artist
 * As a user, I want to be able to log in with my Spotify account to customize my experience
 * As a user, I want to click on a specific artist and listen to their top tracks without navigating to a separate page
 * As a user, I want to be able to play/pause the current song and navigate to the next/previous track
 * As a user, I want to be able to save the current song in my Spotify Saved Tracks
 
## Future Vision


## Technologies
Band Radar was primarily built with React and Node/Express. Other technologies include Docker, Nginx, Digital Ocean, Axios, Babel, and Webpack.
